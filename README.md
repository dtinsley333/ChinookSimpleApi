# ChinookSimpleApi
This is an example of web api app that produces json to load a google bar chart. I included the html file that will 
be doing the calling in the projects for ease of deployment for demo. 

The app is using the Chinook Database.

You can download and install via Sql Script here:
https://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/releases/view/55681

In order to run the app in the browser, the url will be 'http://localhost:59977/'. Append the name of the html file having the chart to the end of the url. http://localhost:59977/ChinookTractSalesPerAlbum.html
